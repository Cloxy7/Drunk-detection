# IR-Based Drunk Detection Using Deep Learning and Facial Cues
This is a deep learning project that combines physiological and thermal face cues to detect signs of intoxication. The model uses pixel-level features and domain-specific features like Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR), and thermal asymmetry to improve accuracy on small datasets.
